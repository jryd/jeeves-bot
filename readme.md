# Jeeves Bot
A Laravel powered Slack integration, serving as your own Cloud based Personal Assistant.

## Current features/response
<ul>

<li>Sending `msg`, Jeeves will begin a conversation with you to determine whether you want to send an email or SMS, who you want to send it to and what you want to say - it'll then take care of the rest.</li>
